# IT Vendor Evaluation Guide for Small Organizations

**Stop wasting money on IT vendors that over-promise and under-deliver.**

This open-source guide helps organizations with fewer than 50 people evaluate proposals from IT service vendors—from managed service providers to web designers to AI solutions—without needing a technical team.

## The Problem

Small nonprofits, community organizations, and businesses face a common challenge: you need reliable IT services, but you lack the technical expertise to properly evaluate vendor proposals. This often leads to:

- **Paying 2-3x what you should** for basic services
- **Vendor lock-in** that makes switching providers prohibitively expensive  
- **Hidden costs** that turn a "$500/month" solution into $3,500/month
- **Security and compliance risks** you didn't know to ask about
- **Contracts that favor the vendor** at every turn
- **"AI-powered" solutions** that are just marketing hype wrapped around basic automation

Meanwhile, vendors know you can't evaluate their technical claims. They rely on this information asymmetry. Some are predatory—they know you're vulnerable and they exploit it.

**This guide levels the playing field.**

## Who This Is For

✅ **Use this guide if you:**
- Have fewer than 50 users/employees
- Need to hire an MSP, web developer, cloud provider, security service, or AI solution
- Don't have in-house IT expertise
- Want to avoid expensive mistakes
- Need to justify vendor decisions to a board or leadership
- Are tired of being talked down to by vendors who assume you don't understand technology

❌ **This probably isn't for you if:**
- You have a full-time IT staff
- You're evaluating enterprise-scale solutions (100+ users)
- You're looking for highly specialized technical procurement (contact us—we might add it!)

## Quick Start

**Need to evaluate a proposal right now?** 

1. **Identify your service type:** [MSP](guides/msp-services.md) | [Web Design](guides/web-design.md) | [AI Services](guides/ai-services.md) | [Cloud](guides/cloud-services.md) | [Security](guides/security-services.md)
2. **Use the evaluation scorecard** in [templates/](templates/)
3. **Check for red flags** in the guide
4. **Run the reference check** using our [question template](templates/reference-check-questions.md)

**Starting from scratch?**
- Read [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) to assess what you actually need

## Common Vendor Red Flags (Preview)

These appear across all service types. **If you see these, proceed with extreme caution:**

### Pricing & Contracts
- 🚩 **"We'll need to assess before pricing"** but won't give you even a range = preparing to overcharge
- 🚩 **Multi-year contracts for unproven relationships** = they know you'll want to leave
- 🚩 **Auto-renewal clauses with 90+ day cancellation notice** = revenue trap
- 🚩 **Unlimited anything** (support, storage, users) = they're lying or will make it painful to use
- 🚩 **Significant setup fees** that aren't detailed = padding the bill

### Technical Claims
- 🚩 **"Industry-leading" or "best-in-class"** without specific metrics = meaningless marketing
- 🚩 **"Military-grade security"** = they don't know what they're talking about
- 🚩 **"AI-powered"** without explaining what model, how it works, or what problem it solves = buzzword bingo
- 🚩 **Guaranteed uptime of 99.9%+** without SLA penalties = empty promise
- 🚩 **"Proprietary technology"** for commodity services = vendor lock-in

### Relationship Dynamics
- 🚩 **High-pressure sales tactics** or "this price expires Friday" = they need you more than you need them
- 🚩 **Can't explain things in plain language** = hiding something or don't understand their own product
- 🚩 **Dismissive of your questions** = they don't respect you
- 🚩 **No references or only cherry-picked ones** = problematic track record
- 🚩 **Proposal is full of typos and template artifacts** = you'll get the same careless service

### Data & Control
- 🚩 **Vague about data ownership** = they think it's theirs
- 🚩 **No clear data export process** = you're trapped
- 🚩 **Can't explain their security practices** = they don't have any
- 🚩 **Require admin access to all your systems** without justification = massive security risk

**Remember:** The cheapest proposal is often the most expensive. The best vendor treats you as a partner, not a mark.

**Vendors:** If you're reading this and thinking "this is unfair to good vendors"—it's not. Good vendors welcome informed clients. If these guidelines make you uncomfortable, ask yourself why.
