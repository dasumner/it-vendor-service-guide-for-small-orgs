Managed Service Provider (MSP) Evaluation Guide
What You’re Actually Buying
An MSP provides ongoing IT support and infrastructure management. Think of them as your outsourced IT department. They should:
	∙	Monitor your systems 24/7 and fix problems before you notice them
	∙	Provide helpdesk support when your staff has IT issues
	∙	Manage security including patches, backups, and threat monitoring
	∙	Plan and execute technology improvements
	∙	Be available during outages and emergencies
What you’re NOT buying:
	∙	A vendor who only shows up when things break (that’s break-fix, not managed services)
	∙	Someone to blame when IT fails (you need a partner who prevents failures)
	∙	A company that treats you like an ATM
Critical Questions to Ask
Service Delivery
“What’s included in your base monthly fee and what costs extra?”
	∙	Good answer: Detailed list with specifics (monitoring, patch management, helpdesk 8am-6pm, monthly security reports, quarterly business reviews)
	∙	Red flag: “Comprehensive managed services” without specifics, or “it depends”
	∙	Why it matters: “All-inclusive” often means nothing is actually included when you need it
“What’s your average response time and resolution time, and what happens if you miss it?”
	∙	Good answer: “30 minutes for critical, 4 hours for high priority. If we miss SLA, you get 10% credit for that month. Here’s our performance from last quarter.”
	∙	Red flag: “Industry-leading response times” or guarantees without penalties
	∙	Why it matters: Without financial penalties, SLAs are just marketing copy
“How do you handle after-hours emergencies?”
	∙	Good answer: “24/7 NOC monitoring. Critical alerts page on-call engineer within 15 minutes. You have direct escalation number.”
	∙	Red flag: “Call the helpdesk and leave a message” or expensive per-incident after-hours fees
	∙	Why it matters: Your email server doesn’t break on schedule
“Who will be our primary engineer and what’s their background?”
	∙	Good answer: Introduces specific person, shares their experience, explains backup coverage
	∙	Red flag: “You’ll work with our team” (you’ll get whoever is available, usually junior staff)
	∙	Why it matters: Relationships matter. You want someone who knows your environment.
Technical Capabilities
“What monitoring tools do you use and can we see the dashboard?”
	∙	Good answer: Names specific tools (SolarWinds, Datto, ConnectWise, etc.), offers to demo the client portal
	∙	Red flag: Proprietary tools or “we’ll set that up if you sign”
	∙	Why it matters: You need visibility into your own infrastructure
“How do you handle backups and what’s your disaster recovery process?”
	∙	Good answer: “Daily incremental, weekly full backups. Encrypted, stored offsite. 4-hour RTO, 1-hour RPO. We test restores monthly. Here’s our DR runbook.”
	∙	Red flag: “We back everything up” without specifics about frequency, testing, or recovery time
	∙	Why it matters: Backups are useless if you can’t restore them quickly
“What’s your patch management process?”
	∙	Good answer: “Critical security patches within 48 hours after testing. Standard patches monthly during maintenance window. We notify you 48 hours before.”
	∙	Red flag: “We keep everything updated” or automatic patches with no testing
	∙	Why it matters: Bad patches break systems. No patches get you hacked.
“How do you handle security incidents?”
	∙	Good answer: “24/7 SIEM monitoring, automated threat response, incident response plan with defined escalation. We’re SOC 2 Type II certified.”
	∙	Red flag: “We have antivirus on everything” or vague “best practices”
	∙	Why it matters: When (not if) you get attacked, you need a real plan
Business Relationship
“What’s your average client retention and why do clients leave?”
	∙	Good answer: “85% retention over 3 years. Clients who leave usually outgrow us or get acquired. Here are three references.”
	∙	Red flag: Evasive answer or “We don’t track that”
	∙	Why it matters: If they can’t keep clients, there’s a reason
“How do you charge for projects vs. ongoing support?”
	∙	Good answer: “Monthly fee covers monitoring, support, and standard maintenance. Projects like migrations are quoted separately with fixed prices. Here’s our rate card.”
	∙	Red flag: “Everything is billable” or vague “we’ll work with you”
	∙	Why it matters: Surprise bills destroy budgets
“What happens to our data and systems if we terminate the contract?”
	∙	Good answer: “30-day transition period included. We’ll export all documentation, hand over admin credentials, and assist new provider. No data held hostage.”
	∙	Red flag: “We’ll need to discuss that” or expensive exit fees
	∙	Why it matters: You need an exit strategy before you sign
“Can you provide three references from organizations similar to ours?”
	∙	Good answer: Provides contacts, ideally in your industry/size, encourages you to call them
	∙	Red flag: “Due to NDAs…” or only gives you their best client
	∙	Why it matters: Similar orgs = relevant experience

Red Flags - MSP Edition
Pricing Red Flags
	∙	🚩 “Unlimited support” - Nothing is unlimited. There will be limits and they’ll appear when you need help most.
	∙	🚩 Per-incident fees for things that should be included - Every email issue shouldn’t cost $150
	∙	🚩 Significant price differences between years 1 and 2 - They’re buying your business then jacking up rates
	∙	🚩 “Per device” pricing without defining “device” - Is a phone a device? A printer? A VM?
	∙	🚩 Setup fees over 1x monthly - They’re padding the bill
Service Red Flags
	∙	🚩 Remote-only support with no onsite option - Some things require hands on keyboards
	∙	🚩 Offshore-only helpdesk during your business hours - Language barriers during emergencies are brutal
	∙	🚩 Tiered support requiring you to troubleshoot first - You’re not paying them to make you do their job
	∙	🚩 No guaranteed response times - “As soon as possible” means “whenever we feel like it”
	∙	🚩 Cloud-only backup with no local copy - You’re one internet outage away from no access to your data
Technical Red Flags
	∙	🚩 “We support everything” - Jack of all trades, master of none
	∙	🚩 Proprietary tools you can’t access - You can’t see what you’re paying for
	∙	🚩 No formal change management - They’ll break things with untested changes
	∙	🚩 Microsoft Partner/certifications are their only credential - Those cost $300/year, they mean nothing
	∙	🚩 Can’t explain their security monitoring - They probably don’t have any
Relationship Red Flags
	∙	🚩 3+ year contract for first engagement - They know you’ll want to leave
	∙	🚩 Auto-renewal with 90+ day cancellation notice - Calendar that now, you’ll forget
	∙	🚩 Insists on admin access to everything immediately - Security risk and control issue
	∙	🚩 Won’t provide references - They don’t have happy clients
	∙	🚩 High-pressure sales tactics - “Sign by Friday for this price” means they’re desperate
Typical Pricing Ranges (2025-2026)

Common Contract Gotchas
What to Negotiate
Auto-renewal:
	∙	Bad: “This agreement automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless cancelled 90 days prior to renewal.”
	∙	Better: “This agreement renews annually with 30 days notice to cancel.”
Termination:
	∙	Bad: “Client may terminate with 90 days notice and payment of early termination fee equal to 3 months service.”
	∙	Better: “Either party may terminate with 30 days notice. No early termination fees after first 90 days.”
Scope creep:
	∙	Bad: “MSP will provide reasonable support for Client’s IT environment.”
	∙	Better: “Services include: [specific list]. Additional services require written approval and separate SOW.”
Data ownership:
	∙	Bad: Silent on data ownership and portability
	∙	Better: “Client retains all ownership of data. MSP will provide all data in standard formats within 15 days of termination at no cost.”
Liability caps:
	∙	Bad: “MSP liability limited to monthly service fee.”
	∙	Better: “MSP liability limited to 12 months of service fees, excluding gross negligence.”
SLA penalties:
	∙	Bad: “MSP will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet SLAs.”
	∙	Better: “Failure to meet SLAs results in 10% service credit per occurrence, maximum 50% monthly fee.”
Real Examples (Anonymized)
Good Proposal Language
“Our standard support package for your 25-person team includes:
	∙	24/7 infrastructure monitoring via SolarWinds
	∙	Helpdesk support 7am-7pm CT, 1-hour response time
	∙	Daily incremental backups, weekly full, 30-day retention
	∙	Monthly patch management during agreed maintenance windows
	∙	Quarterly security assessments and business reviews
	∙	Dedicated engineer: Sarah Chen (10 years experience, healthcare IT)
Cost: $175/user/month = $4,375/month
NOT included (quoted separately):
	∙	After-hours emergency support: $200/hour
	∙	Onsite visits: $150/hour + travel
	∙	Projects (migrations, new deployments): Fixed-price SOW
SLA: 99.5% uptime. Credits: 5% per 0.1% below 99.5%”
Why this is good:
	∙	Specific tools and processes
	∙	Named engineer
	∙	Clear pricing with no surprises
	∙	Honest about what costs extra
	∙	Enforceable SLA with penalties
Bad Proposal Language
“TechPro Solutions offers comprehensive managed IT services leveraging industry-leading tools and best practices to ensure your organization’s technology infrastructure operates at peak performance.
Our team of certified professionals provides:
	∙	Proactive monitoring and management
	∙	Unlimited helpdesk support
	∙	Enterprise-grade security
	∙	Backup and disaster recovery
	∙	Strategic technology planning
Investment: Contact us for custom pricing
We guarantee 99.9% uptime and industry-leading response times.”
Why this is terrible:
	∙	Zero specifics about tools or processes
	∙	“Unlimited” support (lie)
	∙	“Enterprise-grade” is meaningless
	∙	No actual pricing
	∙	SLA with no penalties = worthless promise
	∙	Pure marketing fluff
Real Reference Check Gotcha
What MSP told you to ask their reference:
“How’s your experience with ABC Managed Services?”
What you should actually ask:
	1.	“How long have you worked with them and have you ever tried to leave?”
	2.	“What’s one thing they do poorly that you wish they’d improve?”
	3.	“Have you ever had a major outage? How did they handle it?”
	4.	“Do they explain things clearly or talk down to you?”
	5.	“Have you ever received a surprise bill? For what?”
	6.	“If you could start over, would you choose them again?”
The reference the MSP gives you will be a happy client. But even happy clients will tell you the truth if you ask the right questions.
When NOT to Use an MSP
You might not need an MSP if:
	∙	✅ You have 5 or fewer users with simple needs (Google Workspace + laptop support)
	∙	✅ You have a competent part-time IT person who can handle everything
	∙	✅ You’re comfortable with business risk of no redundancy/backup for your IT person
	∙	✅ Your IT needs are purely software-as-a-service with no on-premise infrastructure
Consider break-fix or consulting hours instead of managed services if:
	∙	Your needs are truly intermittent (a few hours per quarter)
	∙	You have technical leadership who can direct contractors
	∙	You don’t have mission-critical uptime requirements
Decision Framework
Shortlist 3-4 MSPs based on:
	1.	Similar client size/industry
	2.	Geographic proximity (for onsite needs)
	3.	Appropriate pricing tier
	4.	Relevant certifications (if you have compliance needs)
Evaluation process:
	1.	Initial calls (30 min each) - Gut check, basic alignment
	2.	Detailed proposals with specific scope and pricing
	3.	Reference checks (minimum 2 per finalist)
	4.	Technical deep dive (demo their tools, meet your engineer)
	5.	Contract review (attorney review if >$50K annual)
	6.	Final decision based on scorecard + gut
Start small:
	∙	6-month initial term if possible (they’ll want 1+ year)
	∙	Defined pilot scope rather than all-in immediately
	∙	Clear success metrics - What does good look like at 90 days?
